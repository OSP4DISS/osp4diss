This site is about Operating Systems and Programming.
It is "**4DISS**" (for Diss) because the term "**For Dummies**" is already taken!
What is "**4DISS**"?  I do not know!  Do you?

An apology to Wiley Publising Inc:
"for Dummies" and "the Dummies Man logo" are registered trademarks of Wiley Publishing, Inc.
The usage here is humorous intentions and hopefully categorized as "fair use."

Jolan Tru!
